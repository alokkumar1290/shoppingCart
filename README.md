# Frontend Mentor - Audiophile e-commerce website solution

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

✅ View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size

- ❌ See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- ❌ Add/Remove products from the cart
- ✅ Edit product quantities in the cart
- ✅ Fill in all fields in the checkout
- ❌ Receive form validations if fields are missed or incorrect during checkout
- ✅ See correct checkout totals depending on the products in the cart

- Shipping always adds $50 to the order
- VAT is calculated as 20% of the product total, excluding shipping
  ✅ See an order confirmation modal after checking out with an order summary
  ❌ **Bonus**: Keep track of what's in the cart, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

### Things to be fixed

- Picture elements are not quite working. I have to fix them later.
- If I open a popup (let's say a Module), other popup have to be disabled.
- Cart should no be active in Checkout.
- "Remove All" button in Cart is not working

### Useful resources
